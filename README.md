# Best Practices to Avoid High Vercel Bills

This is a recap of the video discussing how to avoid large Vercel bills by implementing various optimization strategies.

## 1. Manage Bandwidth Costs

### **Avoid Large Files in the Public Directory**

- **Issue:** Large assets (e.g., videos, large images) placed in the `public` directory are served via Vercel’s CDN, leading to high bandwidth costs.
- **Best Practices:**
  - **Limit Public Assets Size:** Keep files in the `public` directory under 4KB.
  - **Use Dedicated Asset Hosts:** Utilize services like **Uploadthing**, **Amazon S3**, **Cloudflare R2**, or **Blob Storage** for larger files.
  - **Implementation Tip:** Upload large assets to an external host and update your website to reference these external URLs instead of serving them directly from Vercel.

## 2. Optimize Image Handling

### **Efficient Image Optimization**

- **Issue:** Vercel’s image optimizer can become costly with a high number of image requests and optimizations.
- **Best Practices:**
  - **Limit Image Optimizations:** Keep image optimizations below Vercel’s free tier (e.g., 5,000 optimizations). Beyond this, consider alternative solutions.
  - **Restrict Optimization Paths:** Ensure your image optimization endpoints are secure to prevent abuse. For example, limit optimizations to specific domains or paths.
  - **Use Alternative Image Hosts:** Consider services like **Image Engineering** or other image hosting solutions for more cost-effective optimization.
  - **Implement Server-Side Caching:** Use KV stores or similar technologies to cache images, reducing repeated optimizations and associated costs.

## 3. Optimize Serverless Functions

### **Efficient Code Practices**

- **Issue:** Poorly optimized serverless functions, such as making multiple blocking database calls, can lead to excessive compute times and high costs.
- **Best Practices:**
  - **Minimize Database Calls:** Use optimized queries that fetch all necessary data in a single request. Utilize relations and efficient data fetching strategies.
  - **Use Concurrency:** Implement `Promise.all` to run independent operations concurrently, reducing total compute time.
  - **Implement Queues for Long-Running Tasks:** Offload heavy computations or external API calls to background jobs using services like **Inest** or **trigger.dev**. This prevents serverless functions from being blocked and reduces costs.
  - **Leverage Vercel’s Concurrency Model:** Utilize Vercel’s concurrency features to allow multiple requests to share the same serverless instance when waiting on external operations, thereby lowering compute costs.

### **Caching Strategies**

- **Use Server-Side Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., `unstable_cache` in Vercel) to store frequently accessed data, minimizing repeated computations and database queries.
- **Invalidate Cache Appropriately:** Ensure that cached data is refreshed when necessary by using revalidation tags or other cache invalidation strategies.

## 4. Utilize Static Generation for Suitable Pages

### **Static vs. Dynamic Pages**

- **Issue:** Rendering pages dynamically when they could be statically generated leads to unnecessary serverless compute, increasing costs.
- **Best Practices:**
  - **Static Generation (SSG):** Use SSG for pages that do not require dynamic data (e.g., terms of service, blog posts).
  - **Check Build Outputs:** Use Vercel’s build output and deployment summaries to ensure that as many pages as possible are statically generated.
  - **Avoid Forcing Dynamic Rendering:** Ensure that pages without user-specific data are not set to be dynamically rendered, which would trigger serverless functions on each request.

## 5. Optimize Analytics Usage

### **Choose Cost-Effective Analytics Tools**

- **Issue:** Vercel’s built-in analytics can become expensive at scale, especially when tracking a high number of events.
- **Best Practices:**
  - **Use Dedicated Analytics Services:** Prefer tools like **PostHog**, **Amplitude**, or **Mixpanel** for product analytics and **Google Analytics** or similar for web analytics.
  - **Monitor Event Usage:** Be mindful of the number of events tracked to stay within cost-effective tiers. For example, PostHog offers a generous free tier with cost-effective pricing beyond that.
  - **Avoid Vercel Analytics if Cost-Prohibitive:** Unless Vercel reduces their analytics pricing, consider alternative solutions to manage costs effectively.

## 6. Implement Spend Management Controls

### **Set Budget Limits**

- **Issue:** Unexpected spikes in usage can lead to unexpectedly high bills.
- **Best Practices:**
  - **Use Vercel’s Spend Management:** Set a spending limit within Vercel’s billing settings to cap your monthly expenses.
  - **Enable Notifications:** Configure alerts to notify you when usage approaches predefined thresholds.
  - **Be Aware of Service Downtime:** Setting a spend limit may result in service interruptions once the limit is reached, so use this feature judiciously.

## 7. General Best Practices Applicable to Other Platforms

### **Keep Code and Infrastructure Simple**

- **Minimize Complexity:** Simplify your codebase and infrastructure to reduce unnecessary compute and resource usage.
- **Understand Billing Models:** Familiarize yourself with the billing structures of the platforms you use (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare) to make informed decisions about resource allocation.
- **Monitor and Audit Regularly:** Continuously monitor your usage and audit your deployments to identify and address potential cost drivers promptly.

## Final Takeaways

- **Proactive Management:** Regularly review and optimize your deployment configurations, asset handling, serverless functions, and analytics to keep costs under control.
- **Use External Services Wisely:** Offloading specific tasks (like image hosting or background jobs) to specialized services can lead to significant cost savings.
- **Leverage Caching and Static Generation:** Effective use of caching strategies and static site generation can drastically reduce compute costs and improve performance.
- **Stay Informed and Adapt:** Keep abreast of platform updates and new features that can help optimize your deployments further.

By adhering to these best practices, you can maintain low operational costs on Vercel (or similar platforms) while ensuring your applications remain performant and scalable.
